Have you ever wished the 4D icon could get a fresh coat of paint to match the colorful Mac you just bought?
Or you want to distinguish a version from one another.
4DPaintIcon lets you do this by simply adjusting a few sliders.

[Original app is for Xcode](https://github.com/DerLobi/XcoatOfPaint)

## How to run
### Prebuilt release
Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/mesopelagique/4DPaintIcon/releases/latest/download/4DPaintIcon.zip)

Requires macOS 11 Big Sur

### Build from source
Just download the project and _"Build and Run"_ from Xcode.

## Usage

* Drag the 4D app onto the left side of the app
* Change hue, saturation and brightness to your liking
* Click on "Replace Icon"

If 4D is currently running, you will need to close it and open it again before the icon change takes effect.
